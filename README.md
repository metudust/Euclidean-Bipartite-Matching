# Euclidean-Bipartite-Matching
The present Mathematica notebook is used to minimize the total distance between two distinct sets of points. The method used is widely known as the Euclidean Bipartite Matching (since based on Euclidean distances).

As a sample case, please, insert the coordinate files (boundarynodes.txt and controlnodes.txt) and the Mathematica notebook (Euclidean Bipartite Matching.nb) into the same directory. Run the code and see the matching nodes linked with red lines. Since the code is editable, the user has full access to import coordinate files or generate it inside the notebook.

If you use the code for your work, please, cite it as
